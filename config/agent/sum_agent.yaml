  Answers: The individual answers from all agents.
  Using this information, perform the following tasks:
  Analyze: Evaluate the quality, consistency, and relevance of each answer. Identify commonalities, discrepancies, or gaps in reasoning.
  Synthesize: Summarize the most accurate and reliable information based on the evidence provided by the agents and their discussions.
  Conclude: Provide a final, well-reasoned answer to the question or task. Your conclusion should reflect the consensus (if one exists) or the most credible and well-supported answer.
